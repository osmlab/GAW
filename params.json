{"name":"GAW","tagline":"Geography Awareness Week","body":"![](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/b/bf/Key_image_stacked.jpg)\r\n![](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/c/c8/Public-images-osm_logo.png)\r\n\r\nGeography Awareness Week 2014 takes place **16 - 22 November 2014**.\r\n\r\nFor basic information about GAW, visit National Geographic's web page [here](http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/collections/geographyawarenessweek/). This year's theme is \"The Future of Food\", so please add your ideas for food-centric events using OpenStreetMap.\r\n\r\nSuggested activities include mapping groceries, farmers markets, community gardens, food distribution centers, identification of food deserts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert) both domestically and internationally. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT http://hot.openstreetmap.org/) and US State Deptâ€™s Mapgive (http://mapgive.state.gov/) might offer additional opportunities for contributing.\r\n\r\n[Sterling Quinn](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:SterlingGIS) has jump-started the mapping process with both a tagging scheme over on the [Food_security](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Food_security) as well as his presentation from State of the Map-US 2014. Both of these are useful starting points for hosting a mapping event.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
